# adwordscraper
Scraper for Google Ads
___

## Hypothesis
There are different Google Ads for different users.

## Approach
We want to validate that hypothesis and try to understand the underlying structure.
To do so, we want to develop a crowd-sourcing tool, which scrapes for Google Ads with the different Google Identities of all users.

## Open Questions
- How do the results differ by
    - user
    - location

## Possible Obstacles
- to scrape google searches is officially prohibited --> google.com/robots.txt
- How to make Google think that the search is done by the people and not by the scraper.
